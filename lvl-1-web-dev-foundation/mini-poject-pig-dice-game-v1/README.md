## Pig Dice Game - Console Log Edition
## How to Play:

## Roll the Dice to accumulate points for each round. Keep rolling to build up your score!

## Beware! If you roll a 1, you lose all points accumulated in that round. The round ends, and you start fresh next time.

## Use the Bank Score Button to safely store your points at any time and end your round. Your score will carry over to the next round.

## The first player to reach 100 points wins!

## Good luck and have fun!
