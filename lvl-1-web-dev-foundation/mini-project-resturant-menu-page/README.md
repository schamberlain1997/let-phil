# Restaurant Menu Page

A simple HTML & CSS project where you create a restaurant menu webpage.  
This project helps you practice **semantic HTML**, **basic CSS styling**, and the **developer mindset** of breaking problems into smaller steps.

---

## Learning Goals

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).
- Style text, backgrounds, and layout with CSS.
- Practice attention to detail by making your menu look clean and organized.
- Build confidence by recreating something that feels “real world.”

## Project Instructions

1. **Start with structure (HTML):**

   - Add a `<header>` with your restaurant name.
   - Create 2–3 `<section>` elements (e.g., Appetizers, Main Dishes, Desserts).
   - Inside each section, use an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for each menu item.

2. **Style it (CSS):**

   - Choose fonts, colors, and spacing.
   - Make section titles stand out.
   - Add borders or dividers for neatness.

3. **Iterate:**
   - Don’t try to make it perfect at once.
   - Get the structure working, then style step by step.

## Stretch Goals

If you finish early, try one (or more) of these:

- Add **images** for some food items.
- Highlight a **special item** (different color, badge, or “⭐”).
- Use **Google Fonts** for a custom look.
- Align prices to the **right side** of the menu.
- Put menu sections into **columns** (Appetizers | Mains | Desserts).
- Add **hover effects** (underline or color change when hovering over a menu item).
- Make it **mobile-friendly** so it looks good on a phone.
- Add a **footer** with contact info, hours, or fake social media links.

## Developer Mindset Tips

- **Start simple:** HTML structure first, then style.
- **Break problems down:** Don’t think about “making a menu,” think about “making a header,” “adding one section,” “styling one list.”
- **Google is your friend:** If you don’t know how to align text or add a border, look it up.
- **Iterate:** First draft can be plain — styling makes it come alive.
