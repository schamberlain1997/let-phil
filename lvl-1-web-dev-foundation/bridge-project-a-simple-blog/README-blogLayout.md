# Simple Blog Layout — Bridge Lesson

Welcome to today’s Whop Lab project!

This project is **not about speed** and **not about memorizing code**.  
It’s about learning how developers **think before they write code**.

You will build a simple blog layout using **HTML and CSS**, with optional **JavaScript stretch goals** at the end.

---

## Project Goal

Create a clean blog layout that includes:

- A header with a title and navigation
- A main content area with blog posts
- A sidebar with links
- A footer that stays at the bottom of the page

You are **recreating a layout**, not copying code line-for-line.

---

## BEFORE YOU CODE (This Matters More Than Coding)

### 1 - Draw It Out

On paper or a whiteboard, sketch:

- Header
- Navigation
- Main content
- Sidebar
- Footer

Don’t worry about perfection — boxes are enough.

Ask yourself:

- Which sections are stacked vertically?
- Which sections sit side-by-side?

---

### 2 - Plan the Structure (HTML)

Before writing any CSS, think about:

- What should be a `<header>`?
- What belongs in `<main>`?
- What should be an `<article>`?
- What content makes sense in `<aside>`?

Write down the tags you think you’ll need **before typing them**.

---

### 3 - Identify Problems You’ll Need to Solve

Good developers spot problems _early_.

Some examples:

- How do I place blog posts next to a sidebar?
- How do I center the content on the page?
- How do I keep the footer at the bottom even if there isn’t much content?
- How do I space things without using random margins everywhere?

Write these down before you code.

---

### 4 - Research First, Code Second

You are **expected to Google**.

Good search examples:

- “CSS flexbox two columns”
- “footer stick to bottom flexbox”
- “center content with max-width”

The answer doesn’t need to be perfect — just good enough to move forward.

---

## Build the Layout (HTML + CSS)

Focus on:

- Flexbox for layout
- Spacing and alignment
- Readable structure
- Clean, simple styling

You do **not** need to match the example exactly.

Multiple solutions are valid.

---

## Stretch Goals (Optional JavaScript)

Only attempt these **after** your layout is solid.

### Easy

- Add a button that toggles **dark mode** on the page
- Console.log which nav link was clicked

### Medium

- Add a “Read more…” button that:
  - Logs the post title to the console
  - OR shows an alert with the post name

### Challenge

- Add a button that hides/shows the sidebar
- Change the footer text dynamically using JavaScript

> Hint: You’ll need `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and class toggling.

## Developer Mindset Reminder

- There is **no single correct solution**
- Planning saves more time than coding faster
- Feeling stuck is normal — that’s where learning happens
- If you can explain _why_ your code works, you’re winning

---

## When You’re Done

Ask yourself:

- Could I rebuild this again without looking?
- Do I understand _why_ the layout works?
- What would I change next time?

That’s real progress.

Happy building!
