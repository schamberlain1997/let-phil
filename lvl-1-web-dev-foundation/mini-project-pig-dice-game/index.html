    <p>Pig Dice Game - Console Log Edition</p>
    <p>How to Play:</p>
    <p>Roll the Dice to accumulate points for each round. Keep rolling to build up your score!</p>
    <p>Beware! If you roll a 1, you lose all points accumulated in that round. The round ends, and you start fresh next time.</p>
    <p>Use the Bank Button to safely store your points at any time and end your round. Your score will carry over to the next round.</p>
    <p>The first player to reach 100 points wins!</p>
    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
