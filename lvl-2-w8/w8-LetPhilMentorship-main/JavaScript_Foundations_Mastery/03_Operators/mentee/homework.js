// OPERATORS HOMEWORK – SIMPLE BUDGET
// -------------------------------------------------
// GOAL: Use operators to calculate how much money is left after expenses
//       and print a summary in the console.

// STEP 1: Create a variable called monthlyIncome (number)
//         with how much money you receive in a month.

let monthlyIncome = 4000;

// STEP 2: Create a variable called rentCost (number)
//         with how much you pay for rent.

let rentCost = 815;
// STEP 3: Create a variable called foodCost (number)
//         with how much you spend on food.

let foodCost = 400;
// STEP 4: Create a variable called transportCost (number)
//         with how much you spend on transportation.

let transportCost = 100;

// STEP 5: Create a variable called funBudget (number)
//         with how much money you like to save for fun activities.

let funBudget = 300;

// STEP 6: Create a variable called totalExpenses.
//         Use the + operator to add rentCost, foodCost, transportCost, and funBudget
//         together and store the result in totalExpenses.

let totalExpenses = rentCost + foodCost + transportCost + funBudget;

// STEP 7: Create a variable called moneyLeft.
//         Use the - operator to subtract totalExpenses from monthlyIncome.

let moneyLeft = monthlyIncome - totalExpenses;

// STEP 8: Use console.log to print a clear summary, for example:
//         --- SIMPLE BUDGET ---
//         Monthly income: ...
//         Total expenses: ...
//         Money left: ...

console.log("--- SIMPLE BUDGET ---");
console.log(`Monthly income: $${monthlyIncome}`);
console.log(`Total expenses: $${totalExpenses}`);
console.log(`Money left: $${moneyLeft}`);

// STEP 9: Now imagine you decide to increase your funBudget a little.
//         Use the += operator to add some extra amount to funBudget,
//         for example funBudget += 500;

funBudget += 500;

// STEP 10: Recalculate totalExpenses and moneyLeft with the new funBudget value.

totalExpenses = rentCost + foodCost + transportCost + funBudget;
moneyLeft = monthlyIncome - totalExpenses;

// STEP 11: Use console.log again to print an UPDATED summary
//          that shows how much money is left after increasing your funBudget.

console.log("--- UPDATED SIMPLE BUDGET ---");
console.log(`Monthly income: $${monthlyIncome}`);
console.log(`Total expenses: $${totalExpenses}`);
console.log(`Money left: $${moneyLeft}`);
